# 🚀 AI–ML Learning Journey  
A daily log of my progress as I learn Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and GenAI step-by-step.

This repository documents everything I practice while following the **Apna College PRIME AI/ML curriculum** — starting from Python fundamentals and gradually moving into real-world ML, DL, and GenAI applications.  
Right now, I’m uploading **daily Python code**, and as I progress, this repo will expand into full ML models, visualizations, projects, and GenAI experiments.

---

## 📌 What This Repository Contains (Now & Later)
- **Daily Python coding progress**
- Topic-wise practice files & mini-exercises  
- Clean folder structure following the AI-ML syllabus  
- End-to-end ML/DL/GenAI projects (as I reach those topics)

This repo is not just storage — it’s my learning trail.
