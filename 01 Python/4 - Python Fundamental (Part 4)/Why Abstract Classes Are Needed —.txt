✅ Why Abstract Classes Are Needed — Benefits
1. Enforces required methods

Forces every subclass to implement specific methods.

Prevents “oh shit, I forgot to define that method” bugs.

2. Catches errors early (before runtime)

Without abstraction, missing methods crash your program only when executed.

With abstraction, Python blocks class creation itself if required methods aren’t implemented.

3. Defines a clear contract

Abstract class = rulebook

Subclasses = must follow the rulebook

Everyone knows what methods must exist.

4. Supports clean polymorphism

You can treat different subclasses the same way.

Example: loop through animals and call .make_sound() without checking their type.

5. Improves code structure in large projects

When you have dozens of subclasses, abstraction prevents inconsistent method names.

Keeps architecture predictable and readable.

6. Prevents direct instantiation of “base” class

You don’t want objects of a generic class like Animal, Shape, PaymentMethod.

Abstract class blocks accidental creation of incomplete objects.

❌ Drawbacks of Abstract Classes
1. More boilerplate

Requires decorators (@abstractmethod) and ABC imports.

Slightly more code than normal classes.

2. Reduces flexibility

Forces every subclass to implement the method, even when some subclasses don’t need it.

If you design the abstraction wrong, subclasses feel forced.

3. Overengineering risk

Beginners use abstract classes where they DON'T make sense.

Example: using ABC for Teacher–Student–TA (your earlier example) is pointless.

4. Harder to refactor later

If you modify an abstract method’s signature,

every subclass must be updated → ripple effect.

5. Can lead to deep inheritance chains

Too many abstract base classes → messy hierarchy → harder to understand.

6. Python already allows duck typing

Python doesn’t require abstract classes unlike Java, C#.

Sometimes ABC adds unnecessary rigidity to a language designed to be flexible.

🎯 Simple Mental Model

Abstract class = rules you must follow.
Normal class = do whatever you want.

Use ABC only when you want enforcement, not just organization
